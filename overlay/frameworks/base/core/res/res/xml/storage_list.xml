<!-- The <device> element should contain one or more <storage> elements.
     Exactly one of these should have the attribute primary="true".
     This storage will be the primary external storage and should have mountPoint="/mnt/sdcard".
     Each storage should have both a mountPoint and storageDescription attribute.
     The following attributes are optional:

        primary:    (boolean) this storage is the primary external storage
        removable:  (boolean) this is removable storage (for example, a real SD card)
        emulated:   (boolean) the storage is emulated via the FUSE sdcard daemon
        mtpReserve: (integer) number of megabytes of storage MTP should reserve for free storage
                     (used for emulated storage that is shared with system's data partition)

      A storage should not have both emulated and removable set to true
